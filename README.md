<h1 align=center>Codex Fleurons</h1>

A fleuron is a tool to create athmosphere of the articile using typographical ornaments. 

You can use these on the Codex Press platform by Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) which is a more favorable approach to fleurons. The more common way of adding flare to an article is using fonts that have fleurons instead of characters. Fonts are limited in properties while SVG is an unearthed gem glistering with potential. 

You can control the size and other properties of the fleurons in your articles by including inline asset. When creating a new paragraph a user can source the 'example.svg' in curly quotes { fleurons/example.svg } this imports the desired svg from github for your use.
